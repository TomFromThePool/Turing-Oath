The Promise to Develop Ethical Software

1. I swear to respect the privacy of the user. All user information kept on web servers should be properly protected, encrypted and secured.

2. I swear to not invade the private space of the user. Users will not be spammed, contacted needlessly or have their personal information used without their knowledge.

3. I swear to be transparent in the information I keep on the user. Users should always know all the information that is currently kept on them and have access to it at all times.

4. I swear to release and remove user information at the user's request. Users should be allowed to leave a service or uninstall a product and have all stored personal information on them removed.
